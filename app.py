    AT ITS CORE, data is more than just numbers. It's about people and their stories, their jobs and countries, their struggles and their resilience.
    In this dashboard, we look at two very different but deeply human dimensions of Lebanon's story:
    1. **Total Debt Service in Lebanon (1970-2022)**
    2. **Hepatitis Cases in Lebanon (2015-2018)**  

    Play with the filters to see how each story changes. Different years = different views = new insights!

    **Context:**  
    Debt service refers to the annual payments a country makes on its debtâ€”both the interest owed and the repayment of the borrowed principal.  
    In Lebanon's case, this means the money the government must set aside each year to honor its loans.  

    The chart shows how these payments have grown over time.  
    What looks like a rising line is really the story of reconstruction borrowing after the war, the accumulation of public debt,  
    and the mounting burden of paying creditorsâ€”until the sharp collapse after 2020, when Lebanon defaulted for the first time.

    **What stands out here?**  
    - In the early years, debt service looks almost harmlessâ€”barely noticeable on the chart.  
    - Then, as Lebanon moved into the 2000s, the line shoots up, as the country was leaning harder and harder on borrowed money.  
    - If you slide through the years, you'll see how some spikes match moments of crisisâ€”global downturns, political turmoil, and finally the crash after 2020.  
    - What's striking is not just the numbers, but the story behind them: a country buying time with borrowed dollars, until the clock finally ran out.
