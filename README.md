This Streamlit app was created as part of **MSBA325 â€“ Data Visualization & Communication**.  
It presents two interactive visualizations that highlight different dimensions of Lebanon's story:

1. **Total Debt Service (1970â€“2022)**  
   Tracks Lebanon's annual debt service payments, showing how borrowing and repayment shaped the country's economy, from post-war reconstruction to the 2020 financial collapse.

2. **Hepatitis Cases (2015â€“2018)**  
   Shows reported hepatitis cases over time, highlighting outbreaks, surveillance improvements, and seasonal fluctuations in public health.
